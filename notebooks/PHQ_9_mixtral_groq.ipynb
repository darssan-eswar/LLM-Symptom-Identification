It wasn't a bad break-up, just a sad one. Shortly after the break-up, I noticed I wasn't dealing with it well at all. I couldn't do anything but cry and wishing she would come back. I went to a psychologist and he diagnosed me with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). I still had friendly contact with my ex, but I was just hoping she would come back. After an emotional call, she told me to take a few months for myself. And so I did, but I just got worse. I couldn't do anything. I stopped working, studying, playing sports, everything, because I had no energy or motivation for it. I almost got admitted to a psych ward, but it was still my choice to do stay there or not. I chose to not do it as I had a bad feeling about it. October of last year, I contacted her again and we met for the first time in months. It was supposed to just be friendly, but talking about the relationship was inevitable. She said to me she would never take me back. She wasn't angry, but just serious and honest. It broke me even more. The next day I sent her a goodbye text and was close to killing myself. She called just in time and we had a good talk. Though a few weeks later, when things look better and we actually had made plans to meet up as friends, I got a panic attack and sent her emotional texts. She sent me a long one back and then blocked me. I then attempted suicide again, this time getting hospitalized. I have not directly spoken to her since. It was either via other people or letters. Last December I sent her a suicide letter, but I quickly regretted it. My brother sent her a message for me, apologizing to her and telling her I'm okay. Then for Christmas, I sent her a simple card, but never got a response nor did I expect one to be honest.\\n\\nAt this point I have accepted she won't talk to me, that she will not come back to me and probably will never do so. However, I cannot accept never getting a chance with her again. In March/April she is leaving the country and I fear I will never see or talk to her again in person. All I need is to talk with her and some understanding. Though I know I have messed things up so bad. I have put so much stress on her. I have done everything wrong while I knew better, but still I did it.\\n\\nSo far I have been diagnosed with MDD and Persistent Depressive Disorder (PDD)(so a double depression), and they said I show signs of anxiety, bipolar disorder, and a personality disorder (e.g. avoidant, dependent, anti-social, existential OCD). I am still at the early stages so I won't have a definitive diagnosis for a quite some time still. What is certain is that there is something really wrong with me. Most of it originates from my horrible childhood and upbringing. Only the MDD was actually caused by the break-up. Still, my ex thinks she and the break-up are the main causes of my current state, but that is simply not true. Of course, I cannot tell her as she won't speak to me nor believe me.\\n\\n**Now here is my dilemma: I feel the pressure to move forward with my life. I feel like I have to take on all these life responsibilities again; that I have to live my life to the fullest. I always felt like that, but because I keep overthinking everything I become this passive person who does only the minimum. I feel incredibly weak, pathetic, and scared to do almost anything, like a little kid in grown man's body. Even though I know I can do some things well, I just do not have any solid confidence. If I do nothing then my life won't get better and I will for sure never get back with my ex. Though I don't see the point of putting in all this effort to do things if it doesn't make me happy. I don't even have the energy or motivation for it. Every time I hear someone say: \textit{Move on!}, \textit{Man up!}, \textit{Do }\textb{[this]} \textit{or do }\textb{[that]}, I already feel the pressure and it cripples me. It's not even that I don't want to do it. I really want to live a good and healthy life, but it's like I am incapable of doing so. Seeing other people getting further in life also paralyzes me as well as watching vids on how to improve myself. Everything just scares me and paralyzes me. Still, I know it's the only way out of this and my only chance of ever getting her back. However, there is no guarantee I'll get her back. So that thought is depressing on its own. And don't get me wrong. I know there are other girls out there. That is not the problem. I am not ugly and I can date girls, and I have done so for months already. I have had bad dates and great dates, and I have met great girls I could picture a relationship with, but it simply doesn't do it for me. I want my ex. Even when I put all the emotions aside and try to rationalize it, then I still want her. Right now I just feel trapped. Moving forward won't make me happy. It is not enough. Though sitting still and doing nothing won't make me happy either. At this point, suicide seems like the only solution, but even that is a scary and hard thing to do. However, I feel it's the right thing to do as I feel far too broken and useless to continue this unsatisfying life. I wish there was some magical solution. I wish my ex would give the benefit of the doubt. I wish she would give me another chance. I wish she would make that sacrifice to help me. Though I know that that is ridiculous. I know that I have to do it all by myself; that it is my responsibility... but I cannot do it anymore. I am hopeless, desperate, and dysfunctional... What can I still possibly do?!**\\n\\nCall me anything you want, swear at me, tell me I am a pussy, call me cringy, give me those hard truths again. Do it if you want.\\n\\nThanks for reading.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nTl;dr: GF of 3 years broke up with me over half a year ago. I want her back, but I made every mistake there is. I plunged into depression and I got diagnosed with several mental illnesses. I feel the pressure to move forward, but it's crippling me. I am too weak and scared to go on, especially when I won't get my ex back. I feel absolutely worthless and pathetic. Right now the only solution seems to be suicide because even if I go on I won't be satisfied and happy...\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\",\n",

I don't want to get much into detail but up until some months ago relationship was great, then we started having some minor issues, which bummed me out a little. I never told her about it: it's no big deal, I can't justify being mad about this little thing... I thought. Of course you can figure that these minor issues only began to grew, pushed us apart and ultimately killed the relationship. When we recently talked about this it was already too late, but upon openly talking about the matter I understood her behaviour much better. Probably, if we had talked about that way sooner we could have saved the relationship.\\n\\nThe problem is, it is not the first time I do that. I have had previous relationships die for the same reasons. So here I am once again, depressed because my fear of confrontation killed what was the best relationship, by far, that I have ever had. She was such a great girl and I fucked up everything.\\n\\nI also believe that it was not only lack of communication / confrontation fear. When things were going bad the thought of breaking up was constantly in my head. Again, I never told her about it nor decided to take the step myself. This is probably because I don't have many friends and fear solitude. There are a lot of times already when I feel lonely, especially during the latter months, and I didn't want to make matters worse. However, I am almost sure that having this constant break up thought made me unconsciously sabotage the relationship and be more distant. Of course, talking about this stuff earlier on would have probably helped.\\n\\nI am fed up with this, I know that keeping things to myself and other similar behaviours of mine are only going to keep destroying relationships, but it's like I can't help it. As I said this is not the first time this happens to me and would probably not be the last one if I don't force myself to change.\\n\\nProbably, right now I should focus on getting out of the post-breakup depression (filling the void she left, new hobbies, activities...) and move on but there is a lot in me I'd like to improve, just to name a few:\\n\\n<ul>\\n<li>Manage &amp; control emotions better - as you can gather from all the previous</li>\\n<li>Be more confident: My confidence is not the worst but I find it lacking most of the time</li>\\n<li>Have better human relationships: As I mentioned I don't have too many friends. I usually have a hard time accepting new people into my life. Most of my human interactions feel fictitious, most I get lately are from work (not real friendships). I can go entire weekends home alone without no one contacting me, thus, feeling lonely. I am mostly an introvert, I once saw a post of another fellow introvert that said the best days of his life where when an extrovert <strong> &quot;adopted&quot; him</strong>. Never a post has spoken so much to me.</li>\\n<li>Social anxiety: Not super bad in my case but I tend to get anxious in large groups, especially if I don't know anyone. I tend to feel uncomfortable and out of place.</li>\\n<li>Be less clingy: I have always been the one dumped and I always have a hard time accepting it, probably easy to understand bearing into consideration the previous points.</li>\\n</ul>\\nI have not much of a clue where to start from, however. I believe I've seen people recommend meditation but I never was too sure about it, maybe I should give it a go? Or self-help books? Courses? Seeing a psychologist or some other kind of therapy?\\n\\nMy most sincere thanks to anyone that goes through this entire post, I wanted to keep it short but oh well.\",\n",

Everything started back on the 31st of October of last year when we were having a party in our class because of Halloween, then two bullies entered the classroom, and basically changed my life. There was a bully episode that day, and was the consequence of me changing the section of the class, which means changing classmates and teachers. I made the right choice as I was constantly harrassed by the old classmated and the teachers were bad, like, really bad. So I changed the section, and I thought everything was back to normal. I was wrong. I find it hard to even study now. I can't force myself into doing nothing. Literally nothing. There is nothing I can do even to go to school. It's really fucking hard. I failed my mom. I failed everyone and what I wanted to be. I find myself in the situation where I cry a lot thinking about this. I am a failure. My mom had faith in me. There is still people that love me. My grandparents, my mom, everyone in my family. Except I haven't talked about it to any one of them. I think it would be embarrassing because they can't understand what it's like to be like this. I expect an answer like \\\"you're too young\\\". And they are almost right, except depression can be found at any age. I'm having a mental breakdown, seriously. \\n\\nAs I said before, I struggle when I want to force myself into doing things, like homework or just study. I just want to end it right now. The only thing that makes me sad about it is what my family will think about. It not gonna be their fault. I even failed them. They were never strict with me, always there to love me. But now everything has changed, I'm a disappoint to them even though I don't know it already. They know nothing about my mental state. It's hard guys. Life is hard. And meaningless. The only reason I'm still alive is because of my mom and my family. \",\n",

I always eat before class so I can be energetic and focused (and because stomach grumbles are embarrassing). I always have a healthy big breakfast.\\n\\nMy problem is with weekends and dinner. I’m usually mentally tuckered out after classes and interacting with people and rush to get home. When I come home, all I can do is curl up in my bed and maybe do homework in bed. Even doing something small like changing into PJs and brushing my teeth is very tough. Taking time to prep food and eat it is just a lot of mental effort, even if it’s just microwaving leftovers.\\n\\nI also live with others - I feel safe in my room but going into the kitchen is leaving my safety zone. My roommates are great but at the end of the day I really don’t want to see anyone except maybe my best friend. When he comes over for dinner on occasion I feel motivated to cook and eat, but he usually has evening classes or work so I can’t always rely on his presence. Or if I’m out with friends and we’re getting fast food I can eat because I don’t have to put in any effort and I’m outside anyways.\\n\\nAnd weekends are really tough because I hate leaving my room just for food and I don’t feel the same need to eat without classes to attend or things to do. So I end up eating one very hasty big meal of sandwiches or something when I get really hungry.\\n\\nCan anyone relate? Any psychological tricks people have for making themselves eat and get ready for bed? \\n\\nWhen I was living with family someone would usually tug me to the dinner table at night, but no one does that to me in college :(\\n\\nI find it difficult to stay at a healthy weight for this reason.

The post is long, bear with me. This might be my last post, and I ~want to~ have to get some things out of my chest. I am very tired, and haven't been really feeling anything since yesterday, after I got back from Chicago, so it might be a bit messy, and just... not organized at all. But here goes:\\n\\nI'm so lonely. I want people to like me. But all I am is a waste. A waste of time, resources, and opportunities.\\n\\nBy no means am I the unluckiest person around. I have an above average IQ (152 WISC, 149 WAIS), I have certain traits that I'd like to be proud of, such as being orderly and responsible, speaking 3 languages fluently (EN, ES, KR) and 2 languages in the beginner level (FR and ZH) and know a couple of more alphabets like Cyrillic, Greek and Yiddish, and I absolutely love to learn, read, and to experience. but somehow, even with all that, I managed to be the biggest fucking trainwreck I could possibly imagine. \\n\\nMy father locked me in dark rooms for hours when I was 3 to 5. I was diagnosed w/ T1D when I was 5. I was always a bit weak, underweight. I started having behavioral problems since 10,  including but not limited to: violent tendencies, compulsive lying, stealing (I don't know if it's kleptomania, I hope it's not. But even if it is, won't make another difference. Just another problem on my list). I was diagnosed with Night Terrors and Bipolar Depression when I was 12, 13 maybe. I have suffered from achluophobia and a mild claustrophobia, as well as some social issues. I won't label my social issues, as I haven't got a clinical diagnosis like anyhting else on this list, but I think it fits more into the anti-social category than asocial or social anxiety, because of my negative and possibly misanthropist views. I have 2 past suicide attempts, once by asphyxiation, and the other by insulin overdose. Now, I'm just wasting away, induging myself and slowly poisoning myself.\\n\\nMy only friends (3 or 4), whom I've always valued highly, are distancing away from me slowly, after nearly 6 years of friendship (to be honest, I don't blame them, because I'm fucking weird to hang around. But it does hurt quite a bit). I have a cousin 3 months younger than me, who has a much better and more successful life than me. His father (my mom's younger brother by 1 year) is the current president (33rd) of the Korean-American Association of Chicago and a Northfield Township trustee. My cousin has a better social life, better health (he is 'ripped' as one would describe, and taller than me, while I am barely keeping my muscle mass together. I'm 56kg, 170cm), has better looks than me, is a better student (no problems in school) and is just all-around a better person than me. People follow him around, and as much as it hurts my pride to admit this, I am envious that girls just follow him around.\\n\\nMy family isn't very supportive neither. My aunt and uncle cares for me (I hope) but treats me as if I were some lazy-ass scum, because their son is objectively better than me, even though I am doing my fucking best, trying not to die from a DKA every day. I lost 5-6 pounds in 2 weeks, all muscle mass, because I don't have much body fat. I excercise semi-regularly (45 mins a day, 3-4 hours a wekk, maybe), I study, I do what everyone else does, and I even put more time into it (all possible because I assist school once a month now, all assignemnts are submitted through a school intranet). My grandparents (the ones alive) clearly cares more for my cousins than me, and they don't necessarily hide that. My dad compares me to his former self, and acts like I don't put enough (or any) effort and treats me like a literal pet. People actively avoid me, because my personality is just straight up fucked, and I act so weird, almost pathetic around others, that I'd rather stay at home than humiliate myself in front of others.\\n\\nMy biggest problem and fear is that I'll slowly become my father, because he is the most despicable human being I can think of. He is just such a hypocrite, miserable, self-justifying, rationalizing, condescending piece of shit; but I am so similar to him, whether it be personality, tastes, interests, points of view, etc. Another big fear of mine is that no one will validate my efforts, despite it being my best. But it's already becoming true.\\n\\nI'm just tired of nobody loving me. I had this one girl that I liked since 5 years ago. We were friends; or so I thought, I've discovered a few months back that she's not just not interested in me, but she absolutely despises me. I trusted her with some deepest feelings that I haven't shared with anyone, and I have a feeling she's making fun of me for it with her friends, as I can feel them being very condescending towards me, and making fun of me or just ignoring me.\\n\\nI just think that this is unfair. I don't know how to approach people (hell, I've never gotten a kiss in my life, when 90% of the people my age I know already have boyfriends/girlfriends. Although, I want a more serious, emotional kind of relationship, even though I'll never even get into one), I don't know how to get better and meet everyone's expectations (including mine), and I don't know what to do in general. I've felt even more pathetic during my 2 weeks in Chicago, and I don't know anymore if I want to go to the US for college after I graduate this year (if I make it out, I'm going for a neurology-psychiatry double major, and a linguistics minor or certificate).\\n\\nI have not decided how I want to go yet. I have enough rapid-action Insulin to kill myself in 3-4 hours, a knife (to sever either my jugulars, my carotid artery, femoral artery, or my ulnar artery; I know how much it hurts, I was into self-harm for a year or two, so don't give me that 'it's painful, suicide is not painless' argument), there's a beach about an hour and a half away on foot, where I could drown after getting tied up. At this point, I'm just tired. And if I'm tired already, I don't know how will I carry on for the next 30-ish years of my short life (shorter than most, anyway). I just want to be loved. I want to be able to have someone genuinely love me. Not in the physical way, but I just want to know that I have someone to be there for me, to be willing to share my burdens, as I'm willing to share hers. But I guess that's a luxury I'll never be able to experience.\\n\\nHelp me. I just want a normal life.\",\n",
