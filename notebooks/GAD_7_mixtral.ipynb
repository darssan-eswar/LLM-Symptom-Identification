I don’t know if there’s any other SOs in this thread or if there is another sub I should be posting in) \\n\\nI don’t have anyone I can talk to about this. After about a year into dating, while we were cleaning dishes in her apartment, she let on how serious her depression was when she told me that she had once held a gun to her head. After a long silence we both cried and I told her how much I loved her. She told me that she had only ever told her best friend and didn’t want anyone to know, so I’ve never told anyone, not even my closest friend of 15+ years whom I share anything and everything with. So thank you to whomever shares any words of wisdom you’re all I got. \\n\\nOver the the last year our relationship has dwindled, we still tell each other we love each other constantly and talk about getting engaged/married. But we don’t have conversations like we used to, she always falls asleep on the couch so we don’t sleep together hardly, we don’t have sex at all, I think 6 times total last year, that has been a big point of frustration at least for me - I’ve tried to initiate sex and been shot down so many times that I’ve all but given up at this point, even when it’s your lover, your best friend, it still feels like crap when you get rejected. I’ve tried to talk to her about it many times the day after or some time that is away from sex so we can have a calm conversation about it but everyone so far, every time we have talked she’s gotten worked up and basically says she doesn’t feel like it. We both have HPV so sometimes that gets in the way but whenever we’ve talked it’s always that she’s not in the mood. I feel like she’s not telling me something. \\n\\nI feel as if we’ve stopped growing and are maybe even starting to resent each other, which is scary to me. I get paranoid that she’s cheating on me sometimes, which I highly doubt she is, I think it’s just me trying to rationalize the lack of sex. Most of all I feel like this entire relationship is about her, and it’s frustrating me lately. I honestly don’t mean to sound like a jerk here; I’m certainly not entitled to anything and while I know her story better than anyone I have no idea what it was really like to experience those traumas growing up and how it effects her today. \\n\\nI don’t even know how to explain how I’m feeling. I’m constantly having the internal debate: \\u201cWell what about me?\\u201d- \\u201cFuck about you! What about her!?\\u201d And so on. While writing this post I kind of caught myself switching between my 2 head-spaces.\\n\\nHeadspace A: \\n\\u201cThat being said.. why can’t it be about me sometimes? Shouldn’t a relationship be 50/50? I’ve really never been an attention seeker so I’m fine with 30/70 or 20/80? Anything at this point. It’s not though, everything we do is dictated by her depression.\\u201d\\n\\nHeadspace B:\\n\\u201cA few weeks ago while I was alone doing laundry I just started hysterically crying I couldn’t breathe, it really freaked me out. Earlier that day she had called me crying and saying \\u201cshe just wants it to be over. She just wants to give up. She wants to die\\u201d I love her so much and i’m scared for her and for us.\\u201d\\n\\nAm I just a shitty person for wanting it to be about me sometimes? I feel like a prick even saying that. Of course I’ve never told her about this, she has enough to worry about and I want to be her rock, not another burden, a toddler, whining about not getting enough attention. So I don’t say anything, instead I just get distant, which I recognize and I hate that I do that. I’m just angry at this situation and don’t know how else to react. \\n\\nI want our relationship to be what it once was; fun and exciting. How can I help this relationship? How do I bring up my inner man-child who needs her attention or do I bring it up at all? \\n\\nThanks so much for any help.\",\n",

I also don't pretend anyone to completely read this, I just want to get this weight off somewhere and that this remains as a testimony for anyone who can identify with it and if you do read it you have my gratitude, it's not much but it's the most I can give right now.\\n\\nI am a 20 year old male currently in University studying what I like. Physically, I consider myself to be average, but sometimes I hate what I see in the mirror and sometimes I like what I see in it. Mirrors are a source of unhappiness for me and even if I try to escape my home's mirrors I will often open the camera app of my phone to look at me and take pictures of my face because I don't feel comfortable with what I see.\\n\\nI don't know how much the last thing is related to the following thing, but I am a very timid, shy and silent person however I never have a frown in my face in public because I am always open to talk to anyone because I really need someone to talk to me (I thank and appreciate virtual messages and conversations but I need a real life interaction). I feel guilty because sometimes I transmit this feeling of helplessness, sadness and misery to my dad and my brother and I know my dad thinks there's something wrong with me and I know he is shy to talk to me about it. I am in misery right now, the last real person (who isn't from my family) who I talked with was last September and I still can't consider him my friend because I know how real and genuine friendships feel like judging from my childhood good friendships, I miss those friendships but those persons are now far away, now have a life of their own with girlfriends and friends. I try to contact my first and old friends in Facebook and although they enthusiastically answer we can never get together, and even if we could I would be so embarassed to share with them what my life has become.\\n\\nI have learned to live with it, especially after I got psychological support for some months last semester and even if talking to a therapist was a great relief I felt it was useless. When I was in therapy I was reading at the same time some books of self-improvement but that only created in me a temporary but potent energy and when this energy disappeared I returned to this drab, insipid state. \\n\\nI was in a very decent social circle when I was in school (I am not from the US so this will be difficult to explain), I studied where the rich people and the children of important persons of my country studied so I had what you call 'good connections' and in here you start with the same classmates when you are 3 years old and end with the same classmates when you are 17-18 so we graduate very close to each other emotionally. I feel like I have left that circle and I can't return, I dread that situation of me presenting myself again to those persons and it feels that as years pass they get closer together while I isolate myself more. \\n\\nMy mom always says that University is the best time of the life because you party, go with friends are more independent, and you begin to flourish, grow up and create good or bad experiences. Not for me, I feel like I am in standby, I just watch people have fun. Today I observed my classes to see if there was anyone else like this but everyone had at least one person to talk to. You may say that it is ok to not party if you don't like (although I do like to party from times to times and get drunk, it's just there isn't anybody I can do that with) and even if I didn't like to go to clubs I see everyone with different interests and mindsets forming groups according to what they like, WHY DO I FEEL LIKE I AM NOT PART OF ANY GROUP??? I feel like I don't have any identity that I can show, I feel empty because I have a big fear of being judged for what I am. I want to start giving a fuck but I can't. I fear sharing my musical and literary tastes even to my parents and my brothers.\\n\\nMy parents are constantly pressing me to create 'contacts' that will help me in the future and I feel bad for not doing this because it's like I am missing half of the university experience. \\n\\nI have reached the point where I prefer Mondays over Fridays and Saturdays because I don't have the pressure from anyone to hang out with someone, in fact I now dread Fridays and Saturdays. \\n\\nI feel that if I continue in this state I will get ill (like as in an actual disease), I am the living proof that humans NEED social interactions and are a SOCIAL species, I am getting desperate, I want someone with whom I can share my musical tastes, my fascination for books, footba\n",

I have problems showing affection even to my parents (who I deeply love but I can't externalize that feeling) and I don't want to be like this, I want to have the courage to say 'I love you' directly from my mouth and to be able to feel it truly, I want to have the courage to hug someone without getting uncomfortable, to say nice things when I feel them, to stop being a pessimist piece of shit and finally be happy at least for one entire day. \\n\\nI perfectly know my my mom and dad and I know they think to themselves: 'When will this guy bring a girl or organize a party'? I know they think this and I am sorry I don't have the bravery to speak to them about my problems. My brothers are also very nice to me but they also have their shit together and I know they also ask to themselves 'Why is he like this'? \\n\\nI want the power to love, I am a Roman Catholic and every night and morning I pray, read the Bible and ask to God to give me the power to be happy and give me the gift of love and hope, to remove my extreme anxiety, I want to receive true love but I also want to give true love, I have been assisting to some masses in the Church near my university and I have cried when the priest meditates some passages I can identify with or gives us the command to offer each other the sign of peace because it's the only thing that I feel that loves me. \\n\\nThe only thing that keeps me going is that I know I am in my most critical moment and when things start to get better or I am at my peak in life I want to be able to look back to these moments and say 'wow, that was really my lowest point' to never repeat it again.\\n\\nThank you, dear stranger, if you took part of your busy day to read this and I will be attentive to any advice you can give to me.\\n\\nI wrote this the 24th of January, 2019 at 20:39 GMT -5\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\",\n",

I didn’t have many friends, maybe 2-3 and this stayed until high school. Up until this point, never had a girlfriend and didn’t know how to approach any girl for it.

            "  \"post_text\": \"So I'm 15 and for most of my life I've been treated not badly but like I'm really different as if there were something wrong with me  (pretty much only in school since kindergarten). Other than that I've always been a happy kid with a great sense of humour but in the last few years since becoming a teen things have crashed down on me. I believe it was 2015 my close nan (my mums side, ill get to why that's important later) was diagnosed with dementia (other nan lives on a farm outside my town where she barely sees anybody). In 2017 my cat that I had only had for about 5 years (when he came to my doorstep seemingly only a few weeks/months old) suddenly died from chest cancer and I felt sad mainly because I didn't have much to do with him even though I loved him so much. Although I have had a few pet losses this hurt me for a few months (tear down my face as I'm writing this). The main reason it was so bad was how a normal day turned into hearing he was unable to move when my Aunty went home for a break, and that later turned into the vet saying he should be put down. On to the next crack in my life. Only a few weeks before I was born my dad died (I still don't have it in me to sit with my mum and have that conversation on how it happened), and although I don't feel sad about not having him as I'm used to it since birth, I have heard things about fatherless kids not having as good lives (although I am being co raised by my Aunty who is pretty much a 2nd mother except she can be giving the fatherly tough love some times). There has also been drama including my other Aunty doing drugs and making our life harder (I will say I don't think it is intentional but her stupid choices are messing us all up). There's heaps more I can talk about like my addiction to games even when I'm not enjoying them and the recent passing of artist xxxtentacion (I know he's a very controversial person but I really enjoyed his music and just seeing his face and hearing his messages to his fans). I'm failing at school since year 8 and I'm always feeling worried about how I went in a test or having 1000 bricks on my chest scared what my mum will say when she sees how I went. I spent the entire 2nd half improving and trying my best especially in English where my teacher would repeatedly remind me I'm an intelligent kid but I'm just lazy, and when I thought I had improved I went from the first semester being all C's and turned it into C's and one D. I can't focus on anything important in class, I can't remember stuff and it feels like everything I've explained in this post is coming together and ruining my life, making me feel hopeless and giving me a feeling of life being pointless. My ideal life right now would be one where I can stay home all day without worrying about any responsibilities or having to deal with my peers or school. Being around people seems to make me feel more lonely. Being around family im almost always happy. Avoiding all of these things feels like it would make me feel great again even though me in my right mind would've hated the idea of being alone at home all day with my \textxtquoteboring quot; parents. I don't know what to do. I want to see a doctor deep down but i also don't want to know if there's something wrong, I don't want to do the whole medication and therapy thing. I just want to be a normal kid who can be happy and out there like I used to be. I'm sorry for talking so much but I just wanted to let it all out and ask if people think these are signs that I should seek help. Maybe if there's anybody going through something similar to me who has been diagnosed. Any sign to help me know what's wrong with me because I want to seek help but I don't want to tell my parents about it and have them tell me I'm just going through the teenage stage of life, and then have a doctor tell me the same and make me look and feel even worse. At this point I don't know what I'm talking about but I just don't want to keep feeling like this. If this isn't depression then I don't know what to do because I don't want to have to deal with this horrible feeling in my body anymore.\",\n",

            "\"post\\_text\": \"After 2.5 years of living with my girlfriend she left. I don't want to get much into detail but up until some months ago relationship was great, then we started having some minor issues, which bummed me out a little. I never told her about it: it's no big deal, I can't justify being mad about this little thing... I thought. Of course you can figure that these minor issues only began to grew, pushed us apart and ultimately killed the relationship. When we recently talked about this it was already too late, but upon openly talking about the matter I understood her behaviour much better. Probably, if we had talked about that way sooner we could have saved the relationship.\\n\\nThe problem is, it is not the first time I do that. I have had previous relationships die for the same reasons. So here I am once again, depressed because my fear of confrontation killed what was the best relationship, by far, that I have ever had. She was such a great girl and I fucked up everything.\\n\\nI also believe that it was not only lack of communication / confrontation fear. When things were going bad the thought of breaking up was constantly in my head. Again, I never told her about it nor decided to take the step myself. This is probably because I don't have many friends and fear solitude. There are a lot of times already when I feel lonely, especially during the latter months, and I didn't want to make matters worse. However, I am almost sure that having this constant break up thought made me unconsciously sabotage the relationship and be more distant. Of course, talking about this stuff earlier on would have probably helped.\\n\\nI am fed up with this, I know that keeping things to myself and other similar behaviours of mine are only going to keep destroying relationships, but it's like I can't help it. As I said this is not the first time this happens to me and would probably not be the last one if I don't force myself to change.\\n\\nProbably, right now I should focus on getting out of the post-breakup depression (filling the void she left, new hobbies, activities...) and move on but there is a lot in me I'd like to improve, just to name a few:\\n\\n\\\\- Manage & control emotions better - as you can gather from all the previous\\n\\n\\\\- Be more confident: My confidence is not the worst but I find it lacking most of the time\\n\\n\\\\- Have better human relationships: As I mentioned I don't have too many friends. I usually have a hard time accepting new people into my life. Most of my human interactions feel fictitious, most I get lately are from work (not real friendships). I can go entire weekends home alone without no one contacting me, thus, feeling lonely. I am mostly an introvert, I once saw a post of another fellow introvert that said the best days of his life where when an extrovert 'adopted' him. Never a post has spoken so much to me.\\n\\n\\\\- Social anxiety: Not super bad in my case but I tend to get anxious in large groups, especially if I don't know anyone. I tend to feel uncomfortable and out of place.\\n\\n\\\\- Be less clingy: I have always been the one dumped and I always have a hard time accepting it, probably easy to understand bearing into consideration the previous points.\\n\\nI have not much of a clue where to start from, however. I believe I've seen people recommend meditation but I never was too sure about it, maybe I should give it a go? Or self-help books? Courses? Seeing a psychologist or some other kind of therapy?\\n\\nMy most sincere thanks to anyone that goes through this entire post, I wanted to keep it short but oh well.\",\n",

            "\"post\\_text\": \"I (F, 19) am a sophomore in college. I have a wonderful family-- my three siblings and I are extremely close, and our parents love us and each other. I know I'm very lucky for that. \\n\\nI grew up on a small farm in the desert, and we were dirt poor. Our house was a hundred years old and was built from adobe and railroad ties. The plywood floors had holes in them that snakes and mice would come through, and my sister and I shared a bed until I was twelve. I remember times when all we had to eat was what we had left over from the previous harvest and the animals we had raised. My summers were spent working our land and taking trips with my friends from church and school to the muddy river that only flowed with the snowmelt in the spring and the torrential monsoons in the summer. We always had dogs and barn cats and chickens. It was so simple and easy, and I loved that farm and my life with my whole heart. When I was 15, we moved to a city a few hours away and kept the farm. We'd go up on weekends to take care of little projects, and I would get to see the friends I'd grown up with. I never felt like I had really moved away.\\n\\nI've since started college in a town much closer to my farm, and I go to visit often. My dad stayed up there for work and stays in a trailer we brought up. He takes care of our chickens and farms in the warmer months. Our work weekends are more scattered now that all the kids are grown and moved away.\\n\\nOur house is uninhabitable now and the land is going wild again. Coming home just isn't the same anymore. Lately, all I want, and all I can think about, is to go home. Not just making the drive and seeing my dad and the farm. \\n\\nI fantasize about waking up in the morning in my bed, 10 again, snuggled with my sister against the cold and the wind howling outside. I want to be with my family the way we were when we all lived under the same roof and to work in the garden and take walks through the desert with my brother, looking for elk and coyote tracks in the river basin. I want to hear the native languages I grew up hearing, but not understanding, in school again. I want to go back to the nights when we didn't have enough money to pay our electricity bill and my mom and dad would bring out the oil lamps and our domino set and we'd play games and read by the lamplight and just enjoy each others company. \\n\\nI miss my dad coming home from work, bone-tired and smelling like the propane he would fill train cars with for transport and the way he'd give me a big hug and a snuggle before he went to bed. I miss the tiny town I went to school in and the way I believed in the church I went to whole-heartedly. I miss going to the Fourth of July Rodeo a few towns over. I miss my mom making us oatmeal pancakes and homemade buttermilk syrup on mornings we'd go out to the juniper stands and cut wood for the winter. \\n\\nI go to sleep at night hoping that when I wake up, that is where I am. I wake up in the morning devastated that instead, I've woken up in my apartment to an alarm clock and have to get ready for school and then work. Absolutely devastated. I don't know how to get over it. I am just existing. I can't find joy in anything. I feel like my life has no purpose and that I'm just going through the motions. I'm terrified of the day that one of my family members dies. I'm scared that one day something will happen and we won't see each other again. That I'll come back to the farm and find that everything we'd built is gone and that I will never find comfort. I am at a loss of what to do. \\n\\nI don't know what I want from this post, but I just needed to put these words down and get them off my chest. My parents would be distraught if they knew I was so sad. I just really don't know what to do. If you're still reading this, thank you. I'm sorry for rambling.\",\n",

I always eat before class so I can be energetic and focused (and because stomach grumbles are embarrassing). I always have a healthy big breakfast.\\n\\nMy problem is with weekends and dinner. I’m usually mentally tuckered out after classes and interacting with people and rush to get home. When I come home, all I can do is curl up in my bed and maybe do homework in bed. Even doing something small like changing into PJs and brushing my teeth is very tough. Taking time to prep food and eat it is just a lot of mental effort, even if it’s just microwaving leftovers.\\n\\nI also live with others - I feel safe in my room but going into the kitchen is leaving my safety zone. My roommates are great but at the end of the day I really don’t want to see anyone except maybe my best friend. When he comes over for dinner on occasion I feel motivated to cook and eat, but he usually has evening classes or work so I can’t always rely on his presence. Or if I’m out with friends and we’re getting fast food I can eat because I don’t have to put in any effort and I’m outside anyways.\\n\\nAnd weekends are really tough because I hate leaving my room just for food and I don’t feel the same need to eat without classes to attend or things to do. So I end up eating one very hasty big meal of sandwiches or something when I get really hungry.\\n\\nCan anyone relate? Any psychological tricks people have for making themselves eat and get ready for bed? \\n\\nWhen I was living with family someone would usually tug me to the dinner table at night, but no one does that to me in college :(\\n\\nI find it difficult to stay at a healthy weight for this reason. It’s really easy to drop a few pounds when I’m under additional stress; some weeks I just can’t do dinners at all.\",\n",

I'm too lazy to get grades better than C's, and my social life is worse than an 80 year old retiree with a dead spouse and estranged children. I feel as if my default state is depressed, with small bouts of happiness, then back into the trenches for me. I keep thinking I've found happiness in the love of someone else, only for it to be stomped out and kicked until I taste the blood. I can make people laugh and they seem as if they like me, but when the school day ends and everyone goes home, no one calls, no one texts, and I doubt anyone thinks of me. It's gotten so bad, I don't even like to listen to music anymore, something I used to look forward to a little while ago, now it just seems like unnecessary noise. Every time someone asks what college I'm going to and I reply with \\\\[X\\\\] Community College, I see the disappointment in their eyes. It seems as if everyone else has these nice lives, and the perfect SO. Don't get me wrong, I've had girlfriends, but they never lasted long and ultimately didn't mean much to either person. I know they say having an SO just causes more strife and pain, but I just want to see what a proper relationship is like and experience the life everyone else talks about. I know this story has been told before by countless people before me, and will be told by countless people after me. I just want to escape all of this. I'm not suicidal yet, but I fear what comes next. Wow, I sound like a pretentious asshole reading this back. I just want to know if anyone else has experienced this, and what you did. Or at-least, something I could do to help myself. I will now check my phone every ten seconds hoping for a reply. What a life. \",\n",

If I've fucked up in a relationship or I've hurt someone I loved, I apologise. Even if I am right, I apologise because my father taught me that is the way to do things in relationships with people.  I am always the nice guy in the relationships/friendships and I've started to think that I'm just some beta-male that should've been discarded a long time ago. I have no confidence in my social abilities and I often feel lonely as a result, but then when I am with others I usually feel like a black sheep and/or get irritated with the company to the point where I don't want to be around them.\\n\\nI just got a promotion in my job and didn't even smile or think that it was a good thing. My boss even questioned me if I was happy or excited, to which I replied 'yes' straight-faced. I am confident in my abilities in my job and it is not boring or mundane, but I place no value on it because jobs are something we must do in order to survive. Nothing excites me anymore. I have lost passion for everything. And I just wallow about in self-pity, trying not to become distraught through rage or unhappiness. Until recently I was calling up my parents almost every day enraged or crying with despair. I am sick of dragging everyone down with me because of my emotional outrage.\\n\\nThus, I have made the decision to cut off all contact with everyone I know, family included. My gut feeling is telling me to never speak to anyone ever again because I am so sick of trying. Trying to please everyone, trying to better myself, and trying to do anything.\\n\\nI never take to the internet in search for solutions, but if anyone knows how to change their attitude so that they may continue on the pursuit for happiness, then please, I beg of you, share your wisdom.

At work I feel out of my depth and like I'm just winging it, badly.\\n\\nI just want to escape, and the only way I can think of to escape is suicide but I can't bear the thought of not seeing my son grow up. He is my lifeline but what kind of mother is he growing up with?\\n\\nI cannot motivate myself to tidy up after myself, only my son. I can't motivate myself to take my meds, check in with my therapist, or complete my work properly. I am just existing enough to keep my son fed, bathed and clothed, but I am not looking after myself.\\n\\nSorry if this post had no direction or real question, I just hope there is maybe someone who's been through something similar and is now on the other side who may have some advice. \",\n",

The post is long, bear with me. This might be my last post, and I ~want to~ have to get some things out of my chest. I am very tired, and haven't been really feeling anything since yesterday, after I got back from Chicago, so it might be a bit messy, and just... not organized at all. But here goes:\\n\\nI'm so lonely. I want people to like me. But all I am is a waste. A waste of time, resources, and opportunities.\\n\\nI have an above average IQ (152 WISC, 149 WAIS), I have certain traits that I'd like to be proud of, such as being orderly and responsible, speaking 3 languages fluently (EN, ES, KR) and 2 languages in the beginner level (FR and ZH) and know a couple of more alphabets like Cyrillic, Greek and Yiddish, and I absolutely love to learn, read, and to experience. but somehow, even with all that, I managed to be the biggest fucking trainwreck I could possibly imagine. \\n\\nMy father locked me in dark rooms for hours when I was 3 to 5. I was diagnosed w/ T1D when I was 5. I was always a bit weak, underweight. I started having behavioral problems since 10,  including but not limited to: violent tendencies, compulsive lying, stealing (I don't know if it's kleptomania, I hope it's not. But even if it is, won't make another difference. Just another problem on my list). I was diagnosed with Night Terrors and Bipolar Depression when I was 12, 13 maybe. I have suffered from achluophobia and a mild claustrophobia, as well as some social issues. I won't label my social issues, as I haven't got a clinical diagnosis like anyhting else on this list, but I think it fits more into the anti-social category than asocial or social anxiety, because of my negative and possibly misanthropist views. I have 2 past suicide attempts, once by asphyxiation, and the other by insulin overdose. Now, I'm just wasting away, induging myself and slowly poisoning myself.\\n\\nMy only friends (3 or 4), whom I've always valued highly, are distancing away from me slowly, after nearly 6 years of friendship (to be honest, I don't blame them, because I'm fucking weird to hang around. But it does hurt quite a bit).\\n\\nMy biggest problem and fear is that I'll slowly become my father, because he is the most despicable human being I can think of. He is just such a hypocrite, miserable, self-justifying, rationalizing, condescending piece of shit; but I am so similar to him, whether it be personality, tastes, interests, points of view, etc.\\n\\nI'm just tired of nobody loving me. I had this one girl that I liked since 5 years ago. We were friends; or so I thought, I've discovered a few months back that she's not just not interested in me, but she absolutely despises me. I trusted her with some deepest feelings that I haven't shared with anyone, and I have a feeling she's making fun of me for it with her friends, as I can feel them being very condescending towards me, and making fun of me or just ignoring me.\\n\\nI just think that this is unfair. I don't know how to approach people (hell, I've never gotten a kiss in my life, when 90% of the people my age I know already have boyfriends/girlfriends. Although, I want a more serious, emotional kind of relationship, even though I'll never even get into one).\\n\\nI have not decided how I want to go yet. I have enough rapid-action Insulin to kill myself in 3-4 hours, a knife (to sever either my jugulars, my carotid artery, femoral artery, or my ulnar artery; I know how much it hurts, I was into self-harm for a year or two, so don't give me that 'it's painful, suicide is not painless' argument), there's a beach about an hour and a half away on foot, where I could drown after getting tied up. At this point, I'm just tired.\",\n",

My mood changes so quickly, i get moody quite often, I am constantly doubting myself and after the recent lies from my ‘current’ partner I’ve come to realise I can’t trust him or believe a word he says anymore.

I can’t talk to work because it’s such a stressful job they’d only worry that I may end up taking time off work!\\n\\nI don’t know what to do anymore.\",\n",

It's a thing though and I can't seem to shake off that this is how I feel. I'm not motivated to do much or if I do have the motivation I'm unsure of what to do. So the motivation lingers until it's finally gone from my thoughts. I'm not sure what I'll do with my life, I'm barely living it. I'm not a person that I would like to be and I'm not focused on life. I've been trying to make sense of how I feel. My friends don't speak to me, they straight out don't call or text and haven't for months. They've never really called or texted much, so I question myself and our friendship. I have bad self esteem which makes things wonky. My life has been moderately fine, the colors are just drained. I'm also failing and got no motivation for school as well! I know what I should be doing but I don't seem to care cause I'm depressed. Yeah, so I got no idea what to do with life.
