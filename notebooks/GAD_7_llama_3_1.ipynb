After an emotional call, she told me to take a few months for myself. And so I did, but I just got worse. I couldn't do anything...October of last year, I contacted her again and we met for the first time in months...It was supposed to just be friendly, but talking about the relationship was inevitable. She said to me she would never take me back...It broke me even more. The next day I sent her a goodbye text and was close to killing myself. She called just in time and we had a good talk. Though a few weeks later, when things look better and we actually had made plans to meet up as friends, I got a panic attack and sent her emotional texts...She sent me a long one back and then blocked me...I then attempted suicide again, this time getting hospitalized. I have not directly spoken to her since. It was either via other people or letters...My brother sent her a message for me, apologizing to her and telling her I'm okay...Then for Christmas, I sent her a simple card, but never got a response nor did I expect one to be honest.\\\\n\\\\nAt this point I have accepted she won't talk to me, that she will not come back to me and probably will never do so...However, I cannot accept never getting a chance with her again. In March/April she is leaving the country and I fear I will never see or talk to her again in person...\\\\n\\\\nI still have been diagnosed with MDD and Persistent Depressive Disorder (PDD)(so a double depression), and they said I show signs of anxiety, bipolar disorder, and a personality disorder (e.g. avoidant, dependent, anti-social, existential OCD)... I wish my ex would give the benefit of the doubt... I wish she would give me another chance. I wish she would make that sacrifice to help me. Though I know that that is ridiculous.\\\\n\\\\nCall me anything you want, swear at me, tell me I am a pussy, call me cringy, give me those hard truths again... Do it if you want...\\\\n\\\\nTl;dr: GF of 3 years broke up with me over half a year ago...I plunged into depression and I got diagnosed with several mental illnesses. I feel the pressure to move forward, but it's crippling me... Right now the only solution seems to be suicide because even if I go on I won't be satisfied and happy...\\\\n\\\\n&amp;#x200B;\",\n",

The weird part is that I really love giving head and will be able to get off with just it but when my partner puts their penis inside me I don't feel a thing. I've tried bringing up the subject of my sex loss with my girlfriend and her response was like \\\"because you just don't feel like it sometimes\\\". It feels like she's expecting me to just magically know why I've lost interest in sex or that it will somehow magically fix itself. The truth is, I have no idea. Sometimes I get this weird feeling with my partner like when I'm with her but not during sex and this feeling just kills my libido... \\n\\nAfter months of researching I've come up with a list of possible causes (although none of which really fit our situation). For example, low dopamine levels, high testosterone levels, past trauma, or even low endorphins. However, I believe that this may not be the case with me either. Could you possibly help identify a root cause to our problem?\\n\\nOne thing that I'd like to point out is that this is just with inanimate objects such as my girlfriends' vagina, breasts, hair, etc. Just touching these areas doesn't affect the other. Could this possibly be related to physical factors such as nerve damage or a medical condition?\\n\\nAdditionally, is this a common thing for women to experience? I've searched around but have found nothing but cases of a low libido in men\\\\n\\\\nAny advice or thoughts would be greatly appreciated.\\\\n\\\\nThanks!\",\n",

Since my neighbour died, it’s been constant for me. Every time I see something or hear something, it brings me instantly back to my old life and those problems that I had, which is very difficult for me but the only way my subconscious is able to let me go. The first thing that comes to mind is dealing with anxiety on a daily level. It feels like once the sun rises, my anxiety levels surge to an all-time high and make me want to scream. I wake up every morning at midnight to my neighbours that still ring the bell, only to see that it is just different spiders that have made the hole in the wall and are now enjoying the place where I had forgotten about since 1994. I try to put it past me , go run a few miles and watch an action movie with fellow film enthusiasts but it doesn’t take the edge off. Other things don’t get a chance to settle  before the nightmares kick in, usually starting as soon as we get to bed. Because I have a daily an intense and recurring nightmare (around 10 times a night) - my therapist says it’s quite interesting because all of my nightmares have been quite similar which is my dad always bringing home a woman to upset me - like a cycle that repeats endlessly. But I genuinely worry about my mum. She’s always been really shy around men and she doesn’t have many close friends, and in this time, I swear that the number of men knocking on our door to ask to meet her must have tripled. I genuinely worry that one of them will grab my mum although they are usually quite harmless. Since my childhood was fairly normal, I never had anxiety but I think I deserved to go through some challenges in my adult life so that I can put other stuff to practice and be less rubbish at them. My therapy and attempts to cope will probably just be seen as being selfish. Has anyone else gone through what I am going through? Has anyone felt the effect of a place and got PTSD like this or get symptoms of PTSD in its 5 year mark?\",\n",

She tells me I am very supportive and a great bf but sometimes I don’t think I’m giving the best support. \\n\\n(Sorry for the long post. I don’t know if there’s any other SOs in this thread or if there is another sub I should be posting in) \\n\\nI don’t have anyone I can talk to about this. After about a year into dating, while we were cleaning dishes in her apartment, she let on how serious her depression was when she told me that she had once held a gun to her head. After a long silence we both cried and I told her how much I loved her. She told me that she had only ever told her best friend and didn’t want anyone to know, so I’ve never told anyone, not even my closest friend of 15+ years whom I share anything and everything with. So thank you to whomever shares any words of wisdom you’re all I got. \\n\\nOver the the last year our relationship has dwindled, we still tell each other we love each other constantly and talk about getting engaged/married. But we don’t have conversations like we used to, she always falls asleep on the couch so we don’t sleep together hardly, we don’t have sex at all, I think 6 times total last year, that has been a big point of frustration at least for me - I’ve tried to initiate sex and been shot down so many times that I’ve all but given up at this point, even when it’s your lover, your best friend, it still feels like crap when you get rejected. I’ve tried to talk to her about it many times the day after or some time that is away from sex so we can have a calm conversation about it but everyone so far, every time we have talked she’s gotten worked up and basically says she doesn’t feel like it. We both have HPV so sometimes that gets in the way but whenever we’ve talked it’s always that she’s not in the mood. I feel like she’s not telling me something. \\n\\nI feel as if we’ve stopped growing and are maybe even starting to resent each other, which is scary to me. I get paranoid that she’s cheating on me sometimes, which I highly doubt she is, I think it’s just me trying to rationalize the lack of sex. Most of all I feel like this entire relationship is about her, and it’s frustrating me lately. I honestly don’t mean to sound like a jerk here; I’m certainly not entitled to anything and while I know her story better than anyone I have no idea what it was really like to experience those traumas growing up and how it effects her today. \\n\\nI don’t even know how to explain how I’m feeling. I’m constantly having the internal debate: “Well what about me?”- “Fuck about you! What about her!” And so on. While writing this post I kind of caught myself switching between my 2 head-spaces.\\n\\nHeadspace A: \\n“That being said.. why can’t it be about me sometimes? Shouldn’t a relationship be 50/50? I’ve really never been an attention seeker so I’m fine with 30/70 or 20/80? Anything at this point. It’s not though, everything we do is dictated by her depression.”\\n\\nHeadspace B:\\n“A few weeks ago while I was alone doing laundry I just started hysterically crying I couldn’t breathe, it really freaked me out. Nothing like that has ever happened to me before. Earlier that day she had called me crying and saying “she just wants it to be over. She just wants to give up. She wants to die” I love her so much and I’m scared for her and for us.”\\n\\nAm I just a shitty person for wanting it to be about me sometimes? I feel like a prick even saying that. Of course I’ve never told her about this, she has enough to worry about and I want to be her rock, not another burden, a toddler, whining about not getting enough attention. So I don’t say anything, instead I just get distant, which I recognize and I hate that I do that. I’m just angry at this situation and don’t know how else to react. \\n\\nI want our relationship to be what it once was; fun and exciting. How can I help this relationship? How do I bring up my inner man-child who needs her attention or do I bring it up at all? \\n\\nThanks so much for any help.\",\n",

I've been feeling better for a while. However, after I got with my boyfriend it definitely got better. Now last week I got the shocking diagnosis, that I might not be able to get pregnant naturally because of an undetected infection that I had at some point and I'm going to surgery in a month due to chronic pain as consequence of this infection. I've been really depressed, angry and frustrated lately. I just think that this could have been detected sooner, as I've had pain in my lower abdomen for a while. On top of this, I'm really stressed from university because I have to do a lot of homework and also work. My boyfriend of 2 1/2 months just broke up with me because he said that I've been in a bad mood and he feels affected by this. I can't believe that he would just leave me at a time like this. He's shown 0 empathy for my situation and always said I should stop 'feeling grumpy'. I mean honestly. I moved out of my student housing room during the weekend to go live at my dad's place during this difficult time and discovered that there is mold in my room now. I just feel like I can't catch a break and wonder how I can deal with this. \\n\\nI'm so shocked because he always told me he loves me more than me him and that he really adores me. And now this. I mean it's good that I know this now after such a short time rather than later. No one can use a partner that won't be there for them during difficult times. I'm just having a hard time grasping this situation. I feel even worse now that he told me his reason for breaking up was that my mood had been too bad lately. I am afraid that I will be back to my major depression due to the course of these events. I'm probably gonna phone some therapists soon so that I can deal with this  situation better, as I fear that I might self-harm.\",\n",

I haven't taken any steps to self harm but I have a strong urge to do so. I just want everything to end. I have no drive to do anything. I'm irritable as fuck. Nothing is going right and even if it was I probably wouldn't acknowledge it. Idk how to get out of this mindset-I have absolutely no urge to change anything, which is what everyone keeps telling me to do. I've tried to look for psychiatrists and psychologist's but its super fucking hard in this mental state and there's a shit ton of steps to just get on the waiting list, and finding someone who takes my insurance etc....

I don't want to get much into detail but up until some months ago relationship was great, then we started having some minor issues, which bummed me out a little. I never told her about it: it's no big deal, I can't justify being mad about this little thing... I thought. Of course you can figure that these minor issues only began to grew, pushed us apart and ultimately killed the relationship. When we recently talked about this it was already too late, but upon openly talking about the matter I understood her behaviour much better. Probably, if we had talked about that way sooner we could have saved the relationship.\\n\\nThe problem is, it is not the first time I do that. I have had previous relationships die for the same reasons. So here I am once again, depressed because my fear of confrontation killed what was the best relationship, by far, that I have ever had. She was such a great girl and I fucked up everything.\\n\\nI also believe that it was not only lack of communication / confrontation fear. When things were going bad the thought of breaking up was constantly in my head. Again, I never told her about it nor decided to take the step myself. This is probably because I don't have many friends and fear solitude. There are a lot of times already when I feel lonely, especially during the latter months, and I didn't want to make matters worse. However, I am almost sure that having this constant break up thought made me unconsciously sabotage the relationship and be more distant. Of course, talking about this stuff earlier on would have probably helped.\\n\\nI am fed up with this, I know that keeping things to myself and other similar behaviours of mine are only going to keep destroying relationships, but it's like I can't help it. As I said this is not the first time this happens to me and would probably not be the last one if I don't force myself to change.\\n\\nProbably, right now I should focus on getting out of the post-breakup depression (filling the void she left, new hobbies, activities...) and move on but there is a lot in me I'd like to improve, just to name a few:\\n\\n\\\\- Manage &amp; control emotions better - as you can gather from all the previous\\n\\n\\\\- Be more confident: My confidence is not the worst but I find it lacking most of the time\\n\\n\\\\- Have better human relationships: As I mentioned I don't have too many friends. I usually have a hard time accepting new people into my life. Most of my human interactions feel fictitious, most I get lately are from work (not real friendships). I can go entire weekends home alone without no one contacting me, thus, feeling lonely. I am mostly an introvert, I once saw a post of another fellow introvert that said the best days of his life where when an extrovert \\\"adopted\\\" him. Never a post has spoken so much to me.\\n\\n\\\\- Social anxiety: Not super bad in my case but I tend to get anxious in large groups, especially if I don't know anyone. I tend to feel uncomfortable and out of place.\\n\\n\\\\- Be less clingy: I have always been the one dumped and I always have a hard time accepting it, probably easy to understand bearing into consideration the previous points.\\n\\nI have not much of a clue where to start from, however. I believe I've seen people recommend meditation but I never was too sure about it, maybe I should give it a go? Or self-help books? Courses? Seeing a psychologist or some other kind of therapy?\\n\\nMy most sincere thanks to anyone that goes through this entire post, I wanted to keep it short but oh well.\",\n",

Everything started back on the 31st of October of last year when we were having a party in our class because of Halloween, then two bullies entered the classroom, and basically changed my life. There was a bully episode that day, and was the consequence of me changing the section of the class, which means changing classmates and teachers. I made the right choice as I was constantly harrassed by the old classmated and the teachers were bad, like, really bad. So I changed the section, and I thought everything was back to normal. I was wrong. I find it hard to even study now. I can't force myself into doing nothing. Literally nothing. There is nothing I can do even to go to school. It's really fucking hard. I failed my mom. I failed everyone and what I wanted to be. I find myself in the situation where I cry a lot thinking about this. I am a failure. My mom had faith in me. There is still people that love me. My grandparents, my mom, everyone in my family. Except I haven't talked about it to any one of them. I think it would be embarrassing because they can't understand what it's like to be like this. I expect an answer like \\\"you're too young\\\". And they are almost right, except depression can be found at any age. I'm having a mental breakdown, seriously. \\n\\nAs I said before, I struggle when I want to force myself into doing things, like homework or just study. I just want to end it right now. The only thing that makes me sad about it is what my family will think about. It not gonna be their fault. I even failed them. They were never strict with me, always there to love me. But now everything has changed, I'm a disappoint to them even though I don't know it already. They know nothing about my mental state. It's hard guys. Life is hard. And meaningless.

I'm having trouble reaching out for help, but I'm slowly building the courage  and doing self help because I want to get better and be a happy person.\\n\\nLast night my girlfriend (28f) who has been struggling for a while told me that she's in a really dark place. When I started to lead the discussion into getting help or even just a little self help, she just gave me a flat out no. She's been suffering for years and the various meds and therapy she goes through just help her for a little while and then she goes back to depression.\\n\\nShe says she doesn't want to be different. She doesn't want to work on being happy because then she isn't herself. Doesn't like the feel of being on meds because she isn't herself. She's fine just accepting being depressed as her default state and one day when she's tired of living she'll end it all. She doesn't want to end it now so she's not eligible to be hospitalised. But she is calm and completely certain that eventually she will kill herself.\\n\\nI don't know what to do with such clear and calm certainty. She struggles with similar things that I do. I try to give the answers that hope are true. \\\"what's the point of living when all we do is work and sleep to pay for a place we never use because we're working or sleeping\\\" \\\"I'm not worth saving\\\" \\\"nobody cares\\\" etc, but she just refutes it and stays where she is.\\n\\nProblem is, I leave the country in the next 6 months (so we've always known our relationship has an expiry date) and she has no support network. She has no family and very few friends that are in a position to help out. She's spent quite a lot of time homeless in the past. I don't know what to do. It feels like she only wants to get better if it happens organically, but that is a rarity.\\n\\nTL;DR gf won't get help. She doesn't want to be on meds/therapy because it means she isn't herself, so it's kinda like she just wants to be depressed with the idea that eventually she will kill herself\\n\\nWhat can I do?

I always eat before class so I can be energetic and focused (and because stomach grumbles are embarrassing). I always have a healthy big breakfast.\\n\\nMy problem is with weekends and dinner. I\\u2019m usually mentally tuckered out after classes and interacting with people and rush to get home. When I come home, all I can do is curl up in my bed and maybe do homework in bed. Even doing something small like changing into PJs and brushing my teeth is very tough. Taking time to prep food and eat it is just a lot of mental effort, even if it\\u2019s just microwaving leftovers.\\n\\nI also live with others - I feel safe in my room but going into the kitchen is leaving my safety zone. My roommates are great but at the end of the day I really don\\u2019t want to see anyone except maybe my best friend. When he comes over for dinner on occasion I feel motivated to cook and eat, but he usually has evening classes or work so I can\\u2019t always rely on his presence. Or if I\\u2019m out with friends and we\\u2019re getting fast food I can eat because I don\\u2019t have to put in any effort and I\\u2019m outside anyways.\\n\\nAnd weekends are really tough because I hate leaving my room just for food and I don\\u2019t feel the same need to eat without classes to attend or things to do. So I end up eating one very hasty big meal of sandwiches or something when I get really hungry.\\n\\nCan anyone relate? Any psychological tricks people have for making themselves eat and get ready for bed? \\n\\nWhen I was living with family someone would usually tug me to the dinner table at night, but no one does that to me in college :(\\n\\nI find it difficult to stay at a healthy weight for this reason.

Sometimes I think I see him looking at his phone as if checking messages from someone else which triggers more anxiety about our relationship. He wants me to contact him first which I found kind of rude, but then realized why he does this because he values his alone time and I can be quite needy asking for constant reassurance. Lately, I found myself feeling sad and hopeless even when nothing particularly bad is happening. I feel like everything in my world is falling apart.

I'm too lazy to get grades better than C's, and my social life is worse than an 80 year old retiree with a dead spouse and estranged children. I feel as if my default state is depressed, with small bouts of happiness, then back into the trenches for me. I keep thinking I've found happiness in the love of someone else, only for it to be stomped out and kicked until I taste the blood. I can make people laugh and they seem as if they like me, but when the school day ends and everyone goes home, no one calls, no one texts, and I doubt anyone thinks of me. It's gotten so bad, I don't even like to listen to music anymore, something I used to look forward to a little while ago, now it just seems like unnecessary noise. Every time someone asks what college I'm going to and I reply with \\\\[X\\\\] Community College, I see the disappointment in their eyes. It seems as if everyone else has these nice lives, and the perfect SO. Don't get me wrong, I've had girlfriends, but they never lasted long and ultimately didn't mean much to either person. I know they say having an SO just causes more strife and pain, but I just want to see what a proper relationship is like and experience the life everyone else talks about. I know this story has been told before by countless people before me, and will be told by countless people after me. I just want to escape all of this. I'm not suicidal yet, but I fear what comes next. Wow, I sound like a pretentious asshole reading this back. I just want to know if anyone else has experienced this, and what you did. Or at-least, something I could do to help myself. I will now check my phone every ten seconds hoping for a reply. What a life. \",\n",

The last year of my life I have been battling with severe depression and anxiety, and was just recently hospitalized for a week in a psychiatric ward. At this point, I feel so incurable- nothing has helped. I have seen my therapist for a year, seemed professional medical help, took the numerous amount of pills and have not felt the slightest bit better. Things have gotten worse than before. I have laundry piling up in the corner of my room and at this point I just pull out any clean clothes I can find in my dresser. Showers? HA- even a short 5 minute shower seems to take too much energy at this point. AND I AM SO SICK AND TIRED OF HEARING THE SAME BULLSHIT LINES OF \\\"It will get better,\\\" and \\\"You have nothing to be depressed about,\\\" or \\\"Everything will be fine because it always works out.\\\"\n",
            "\\n\\nTo be honest, my depression has just spiraled out of control at this point. I can't look at myself in the mirror and hate everything about myself- internally, externally and mentally. I hate myself- and the people I am hurting. I could have a good day, but at the end of the day my suicidal thoughts still sit in the back of my head. Sometimes I sit and regret not just doing it- blade to my wrist and a family member walks in. I had the blade in my right hand, resting on my left forearm- and I regret not ending my life there when I had the motherfucken chance.\",\n",

I've lost control over my emotions and physical reactions. I used to be able to control these aspects of myself but since my diagnosis, I feel like I'm struggling a lot more.\\n\\nI've started using medication again but I'm not sure if I should still be taking it. Lately, I've been experiencing a lot of mixed feelings. At first, I feel happy and excited, but then quickly become disheartened and frustrated. I have trouble managing my emotions and I get overwhelmed easily.\\n\\nOne time, I was at home and suddenly felt a surge of energy. I went outside and started speeding by my house, recklessly driving and completely giving in to my emotions. This scares me a lot and I wish that I can go back to how I was before my bipolar diagnosis. However, my doctor says that this is common and that my medication is working as it should.  The problem is the side effects, particularly, the ones that cause memory loss and frustration.\\n\\nI'm starting to think that maybe the medication is the problem instead of my illness. But then I get disappointed in myself, and experience a lot of emotional pain at myself. I have been making some bad choices lately. Mainly, when I've been drunk. I get in arguments, speak without thinking, and all other things. I try to avoid speaking because I will generally make myself guilty during conversations.\\n\\nI normally drink quite a bit but since I have bipolar my drunk periods are more reckless than when I was younger.\\n\\nI've not only got mental illness to look at, but also social anxiety, hypochondria, and other complex factors to consider. It sounds like everything is just getting super mixed up in my brain.\",\n",

Does anyone else feel the same way, and if so, how do you handle these situations? I have found that I get anxious when meeting new people, especially if I think i might have to have a conversation with them, the worst is when I have to work with someone from H.R. for any purpose. It usually leads me to be very formal and distant.  However I've been trying to sort of 'make friends' with this mindset but it's extremely hard.

            "  \"post_text\": \"Hello\\n\\nI have been on an incredible streak with nofap, which i thought would help with my depression. I lost my counter but it should be over 200 days now. I used to suffer everyday by watching porn and edging/climaxing with a pillow or hand in order to fall asleep. It was a huge struggle for many years, but now, I find it easy not to do both those things. Potentially having someone to sleep with has helped me not relapse, however, I have not felt any benefits of Nofap and it's frustrating.\\n\\nI was depressed before, I'm depressed now. I had no motivation before, I have none now. The only reason I keep going is because of my will power.. and I feel at my breaking point. I am educated, with a stable job now and a wonderful girlfriend and friends who all love me. I count those blessings daily, but its so difficult because I am very negative. No positive thoughts run through my mind, just negative ones and negative memories. My SO and I have sex almost daily, but it''s hard for me to get hard. She excites me greatly, but its difficult for me to have sensation there or to will myself to get hard because I have thoughts like I am too small or I remind myself she has had sex before me and I'm just so in my head, she wants me to be dominant but I really act submissive.\\n\\nI work out, I am extremely fit. I am very physically attractive according to many people, I have a lot of charm as people love to point out to me. Why don't i see any of it? why do i not like myself? i don't have a semblance of a identity and my brain is so foggy. I discussed with my therapist, and Meds are on the table but i don't think that will help me be more confident with myself... i cant meditate for long because my thoughts are just so painful. I am very introverted.any one can help me with any of this? or just to cheer me up? I am an introvert who wants to learn to be more social and just to relax and have control of my thoughts. I can give advice on Nofap and how to succeed on your goals, I can motivate other people easily enough its just my relationship with myself isn't the best.\\n\\nTLDR- sorry for my rambling, i don't feel the benefits of Nofap 200+ days... i am still depressed and awkward.\",\n",

I feel like a burden to my family and when they see me, they feel sad. They won't say anything but I can see it. It's a cold and dark place that I'm living. It feels like a death trap. I've been on antidepressants before for my anxiety and it didn't work. I also smoked for 10 years before that so I'm pretty sure I've done damage to my brain. The reason I went to a doctor was because of my anxiety, but now I'm dealing with depression. I'm feeling sad most of the time, like 90% of the year I feel this weight just keeping me down. I try to put on a brave face for the people that care about me but I'm a prisoner in my own mind. I had to leave a job not long ago due to the anxiety that was affecting my work. I'm struggling to get a new job, which is also not helping with my anxiety. It feels like the world is moving forward and I'm stuck in it. My anxiety holds me back from even trying, because I'm afraid that if I don't succeed, who cares? So I don't try at all. Which puts me further back in the running.\",\n",

It's hard to be happy when you don't see it making sense to be happy. People don't understand a lot of the time and tell me to just live your best life and be positive or whatever. I still feel this way, and it confuses me as much as everyone else. I'm not sure if I want to feel the way I do. It'd be nice if I completely forget and never see being depressed as a thing that exists. It's a thing though and I can't seem to shake off that this is how I feel. I'm not motivated to do much or if I do have the motivation I'm unsure of what to do. So the motivation lingers until it's finally gone from my thoughts. I'm not sure what I'll do with my life, I'm barely living it. I'm not a person that I would like to be and I'm not focused on life. I've been trying to make sense of how I feel. My friends don't speak to me, they straight out don't call or text and haven't for months. They've never really called or texted much, so I question myself and our friendship. I have bad self esteem which makes things wonky. My life has been moderately fine, the colors are just drained. I'm also failing and got no motivation for school as well! I know what I should be doing but I don't seem to care cause I'm depressed. Yeah, so I got no idea what to do with life. Any advice that'd help me out?\",\n",

Using someone’s word and putting it as your own for meaning honestly is not honest.
